This is a modified version of Doug Hellman's virtualenv wrappers.  His
code has since changed quite a bit, but hopefully at some point we can
push these changes upstream (or at least propose it).  But it wasn't
immediately obvious how to fit my changes into the new code.  Fernando
Perez also made many changes to the script, so it also wasn't clear
where the original fork happened.

For the most part one follows the tutorial on Doug's blog post.
Basically you defined a WORKON_HOME environment variable and source
the utils script form your .bashrc:

# virtualenv setup
# Using Doug Hellman's virtualenvwrapper code.
export WORKON_HOME="$HOME/local/virtualenv"
source $HOME/.virtualenv_utils

`mkvirtualenv` to make a virtual environment.
`workon` to switch into a virtual env.

The modifications to the standard virtualenvwrapper is that `workon`
will launch a new bash shell, so you can simply type `exit` to exit
the virtualenv.  I've also added a `isolated` flag to `workon` which
will redefined the PYTHONPATH environment variable to only include the
virtualenv environment.  In this way you can get a completely isolated
environment:
